# IDM222 Final Project

This page describes an assignment for this course. Due dates and submissions are handled through [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/).

## Final Project

The final project is a fully functioning, fluid, responsive website, built with HTML and CSS. JavaScript enhancements are okay, as long as they are all functioning properly and used as progressive enhancement. The primary focus should be HTML structure and CSS.

Your final project represents the culmination of past ten weeks.  This project will be graded based on the following criteria:

1. Code Quality
    - Is all of your code valid?
    - Did you follow best practices regarding file names, characters, coding styles?
    - Is your code legible and easy to navigate?
    - Does your code use comments?
1. Functionality
    - Everything needs to work (e.g. links, videos, audio, images, rollovers etc.). If it's part of your site it must be working properly.
1. Design
    - Is your site visually pleasing?
    - Is your content legible with proper contrast, color scheme, typography etc.?
    - Would you feel comfortable using this project in a job interview as an example of your skills?

## Expectations

Here are some things I'll be looking for when grading your final assignment. A great final project will have these features:
- Website looks great on mobile, desktop, and everywhere in between (the smallest size you have to account for is 320px)
- Uses flexbox when appropriate
- Uses CSS Grid when appropriate
- All images are responsive (uses responsive image techniques, high quality image on desktop and lower quality image on mobile)
- Uses CSS custom properties for frequently repeated values (brand color, black color values, white color values, etc)
- Uses BEM syntax to structure class names
- Uses semantic HTML tags wherever possible
- Doesn't use ids to style elements (#container1 { ...css } is bad)
- CSS animations and transitions are used to smoothen interactivity
- Great design
- Properly indented HTML and CSS

Reminder: this HTML and CSS should be drastically different than the code for your IDM-221 final. If it's not, that is a problem. I'll be checking.

## Submitting the Assignment

The assignment will be due the last day of finals week. That is Friday, March 18, 2022 at 6:00pm.

Submit the following items in [Drexel Blackboard](https://learn.dcollege.net/) under **Final Project**:

1. A link to your self hosted website project page. From this page, I can fully engage the project and have access to all supplementary pages and functions.
2. A link to your GitHub repository containing the code for your final project. Remember: a well maintained repository does not include binary files, but these files are essential to your project. Host the files on your server and use documentation within your project to include references and links for downloads of critical binary files. Your repository **must** follow the following naming convention: _idm222-xxx123_ where _xxx123_ is your student ID shorthand.

**Late submissions receive zero points.**
