    - Started reading [You Don't Know JS by Kyle Simpson](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084BNMN7T)

- Started learning on Youtube (Brad Traversy is the best) 
- Learned what interested me on [codecademy](https://codecademy.com)

- [started messing with a Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
- [started using 3rd party APIs like twilio for sending texts through code](https://twilio.com)

## How to find a job

- [Built in](https://builtin.com)
    - I used built in NYC
- Make friends with internet people
- People are always eager to help, just be NICE and thankful

---

## Career tips

- No matter what you do, tech is the best and **it's not even close**
- LinkedIn *kinda* sucks?
- Wait before getting a masters degree in tech, companies pay for it
- Be friendly, be gracious, be kind, be curious
- Use the alumni!

---

## Career tips part 2
- Careful going back to your co-op job, you might get underpaid
- Job hopping isn't easy, but it's the quickest way to earn the most
- With the skills you'll have at graduation, you should be looking for an $80k - $130k pay range
- [Glassdoor to see salaries](https://glassdoor.com)

---

## How to keep getting better
- Build, build, build (practice makes perfect)
- Share, share, share
- Keep using what you learned in past projects and advance it a little more
- Google everything you don't know
- Patience is everything
- HAVE FUN
- Most things have instructions somewhere...

---

## How to keep getting better part 2
- Get comfortable in documentation
- Everything comes with instructions
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior) is a great example, but every library has some

## Career Tips From my coworkers
- Imposter syndrome is real, don't give in
    - It takes a long time to get up and running at a new job
    - It's normal to be confused
    - You're going to learn A LOT at that first job
- Be ready for a career of learning and change
- You will always be a noob at something
    - We were all noobs once and will be noobs again. Have empathy for those around you.
- Try everything you can think of before asking for help. When asking, let them know what you tried.
    - If you tried everything, ask for help!
- Asking questions is SMART, not stupid
- Bad jobs are like bad relationships, avoid and leave toxicity ASAP
