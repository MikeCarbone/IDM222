# Week 6

## Preprocessors

^ Does anyone know what a preprocessor is or how it is used? Preprocessors can greatly accelerate development when used correctly. A preprocessor takes an arbitrary source file and converts it into something that the browser understands. There are preprocessor tools for CSS and JavaScript.

---

### CSS Preprocessors [^Demaree, 2011]

```css
html {
  font-size: 100%;
}
body {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  margin: 3rem;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 3rem;
  margin: 1.5rem 0 .95rem;
}
```

^ CSS' simplicity has always been one of its defining, most welcome features. CSS style sheets are just long lists of rules, each consisting of a selector and some styles to apply. But as our websites and applications get bigger and become more complex, and target a wider range of devices and screen sizes, this simplicity has become a liability.

[^Demaree, 2011]: [Getting Started with Sass](http://alistapart.com/article/getting-started-with-sass).

---

```scss
body.home {
  .media-unit {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    background-color: #fff;
    .right {
      border-left: 1px solid #ccc;
      h1 {
        font-size: 24px;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

^ Since browsers aren’t ready for a new CSS, developers have designed a new style sheet syntax with features to help make their increasingly complex CSS easier to write and manage, then use a preprocessor (a program that runs on your computer or server) to translate the new smart syntax (next slide)

---

```css
body.home .media-unit {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  background-color: #fff;
}
body.home .media-unit .right {
  border-left: 1px solid #ccc;
}
body.home .media-unit .right h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

^ into the old, dumb CSS that browsers understand.

---

## SASS

(syntactically awesome style sheets)

^ The new stylesheet syntax they developed is called Sass, which stands for "syntactically awesome style sheets."

---

### SASS Syntax

```scss
#main
  color: blue
  font-size: 0.3em
```

^ The original versions of Sass looked very different from regular CSS; there were no curly braces, and properties had to be indented with a specific number of spaces or else the compiler would raise an error. Because Sass’ indented syntax wasn’t compatible with regular CSS, it was difficult for people with large existing websites to start taking advantage of it without spending time converting their old code to Sass.

---

## SASS 3.0 (SCSS)

Sassy CSS

^ So in Sass 3.0 the developers introduced a new, more CSS-like syntax called SCSS (or "Sassy CSS"). SCSS is what the nerds call a "strict superset" of regular CSS, which means anything that’s valid CSS is also valid SCSS. In other words, all of your existing style sheets should work with the Sass processor with no problems, allowing you to get your feet wet by playing with some Sass features without learning every facet of the new language.

---

```scss
nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li { display: inline-block; }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
```

^ Unlike regular CSS, Sass’ SCSS is a real scripting language, with expressions, functions, variables, conditional logic, and loops. You don’t have to use all of these features to get some benefit out of Sass, but they’re there if you need them, and on large projects they can make complex or repetitive CSS much easier to write.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# install sass gem
gem install sass

# run Sass from the command line
sass input.scss output.css

# watch a Sass file
sass --watch input.scss:output.css
```

^ Sass is written in Ruby; if you're familiar with Ruby and your computer's command prompt, you can find instructions for installing and running the Sass gem on [the Sass website](http://sass-lang.com/).

---

![fit](https://incident57.com/codekit/images/versionhistory/ck3about@2x.png)

^ For those who are less handy on the command line, or who just want a fast and easy way to work with Sass, there’s various desktop applications available for Mac and Windows that come with Ruby and has the Sass compiler built in.

---

    my_project/
      index.html
      css/
        main_style.css
      scss/
        main_style.scss
        _mixins.scss
        _colors.scss

^ Both the Sass command line tool and the desktop applications work by watching your SCSS style sheets for changes as you work on them, then automatically compiling them into regular CSS when you save. The directory where your Sass files live is called the _input folder_. Your processed CSS files are saved to the _output file_.

---

    build/
      index.html
      css/
        styles.css
    src/
      scss/
        components/
          _buttons.scss
          _header.scss
        global/
          _settings.scss
        vendor/
          _font-awesome.scss
        styles.scss

^ Here's another project structure. The files whose names start with underscores are called _partials_. As the name would imply they contain "partial" style sheets, chunks of SCSS code to be imported into one of of your main SCSS files.

---

### Using Partials (CSS)

```css
@import url('/shared/global.css');
@import url('/pages/home.css');
@import url('/pages/blog.css');
```

^ CSS already provides the `@import` directive for linking to additional, external style sheets, and some developers like to use it to break up a large project’s styles into smaller logical chunks. For example, our main_style.css file might contain nothing but `@import` statements linking to a bunch of page-specific style sheets.

^ This isn’t considered the best practice however, because each of these imports is one more file that has to be requested and loaded by the browser, which can make your site load more slowly.

---

### Using Partials (SCSS)

```scss
@import 'shared/global';
@import 'pages/home';
@import 'pages/blog';
```

^ Sass helps out by letting you break large style sheets into partials. You still refer to them using the `@import` directive (in a new, briefer form), and when your SCSS files are processed, the contents of the partial are inserted directly into the output CSS.

^ The result is one file containing all of your styles. Sass can also automatically minify its CSS output, stripping out unnecessary white space or line breaks to optimize loading times.

---

## DRY (don't repeat yourself)

```css
body.home .media-unit {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  background-color: #fff;
}
body.home .media-unit .right {
  border-left: 1px solid #ccc;
}
body.home .media-unit .right h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

^ Now that our style sheets are better organized, let's try to make them less repetitive. One of Sass's nicest features is _nested rules_. In a regular CSS file, rules must be listed sequentially, and every rule's selector must include all of its elements.

^ Apart from being really, really repetitive, this code doesn’t do anything to help us understand how the HTML elements we’re styling relate to each other.

---

## DRY Nesting

```scss
body.home {
  .media-unit {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    background-color: #fff;
    .right {
      border-left: 1px solid #ccc;
      h1 {
        font-size: 24px;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

^ With nesting, we can write SCSS code that is both less redundant and easier to follow:

^ After processing this will result in the same CSS as above. Unfortunately, the shorter syntax won’t make your CSS files any smaller or load any faster. But nesting will help keep your code clean, logical, and well-organized, which should also make it easier to manage over time.

---

## Nesting

```scss
.container {
  width: 100%;
  /* If the device is wider than 940px,
  incorporate a max-width. */
  @media screen and (min-width: 58.75em) {
    max-width: 56.25rem;
  }
}
```

^ Another cool nesting trick: Sass allows you to nest media queries inside other rules, making it easier to see which styles are applied to a given object on your page:

---

## Nesting

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 58.75em) {
  .container {
    max-width: 56.25rem;
  }
}
```

^ When processing this file, Sass knows how to convert this back into valid CSS, copying the .container selector inside the media query like so:

---

## Variables

```scss
$variable_name: "value";
```

^ Sass variables are great for two reasons. First, and most importantly, they make code easier to change by reducing duplication. But they also allow you to assign names to special property values like colors, which helps you understand the intent behind a given style.

---

## Variables

```css
button {
  background-color: #99cc00;
}
h1, h2 {
  color: #99cc00;
}
div {
  border: 3px solid #99cc00;
}
```

^ Let's pretend we're working on a large scale site where a number of elements in the UI use a specific green color, `#99cc00`, or "Brand green" for short. This color appears hundreds of times in the CSS, used on everything from buttons to headline colors; if we ever changed the branding colors away from this shade of green it would be a lot of work to change every instance of this color code.

---

## Variables

```scss
$branding-green: "#99cc00";
$branding-link-color: $branding-green;

a {
  color: $branding-link-color;
}
```

^ By using variables instead of the raw hex code, it's easy - just change the variable and the new color appears everywhere, instantly. You can even set variables to other variables, which helps keep your style sheets semantic:

---

## Variables

```scss
$sans-serif-font: 'ff-dagny-web-pro', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
$serif-font: 'ff-tisa-web-pro', Georgia, Times, serif;

.banner h1 {
  font-family: $sans-serif-font;
}
```

^ You can assign almost any kind of value to a variable; apart from color hex values, they're especially good for `font-family` stacks:

---

## Mixins

```scss
$highlight-color: #ffa;

@mixin highlighted-bold-text {
  font-weight: bold;
  background-color: $highlight-color;
}

.result-with-highlights {
  span {
    @include highlighted-bold-text;
  }
}
```

^ _Mixins_ are reusable sets of properties or rules that you include, or "mix", into other rules. You define them using the `@mixing` keyword and include them using the `@include` keyword.

---

## Mixins

```scss
.result-with-highlights {
  span {
    @include highlighted-bold-text;
  }
}

.highlighted {
  @include highlighted-bold-text;
}
```

^ Once you’ve defined a mixin, you can reuse it anywhere else in the same file. Here I’m saying that elements with a class named highlighted should also have the color and font weight properties specified by the mixin:

---

## Mixins

```scss
@mixin transition($args) {
  -webkit-transition: $args;
  -moz-transition: $args;
  -ms-transition: $args;
  -o-transition: $args;
  transition: $args;
}

a {
  color: gray;
  @include transition(color .3s ease);
  &:hover {
    color: black;
  }
}
```

^ This is really useful for applying new CSS3 properties to elements, while ensuring wide cross-browser compatibility via vendor prefixes and fallback stacks. In regular CSS, vendor fallbacks can be annoying to use because they’re so verbose, which leads to a lot of boring copy-and-pasting. Sass mixins let us use new kinds of styles in a bulletproof way without writing a lot of code.

^ Here I’ve defined a mixin that builds a simple transition using vendor-prefixed properties for WebKit, Firefox, and IE, followed by the standard `transition` property from the CSS3 spec. The argument we pass includes which property, the duration and timing function of the transition, which can be unique every time we use the mixin.

---

## Mixins

```scss
$color: #99cc00;

@mixin button {
	background-color: $color;
	border: 1px solid mix(black, $color, 25%);
	border-radius: 5px;
	padding: .25em .5em;

	&:hover {
		cursor: pointer;
		background-color: mix(black, $color, 15%);
		border-color: mix(black, $color, 40%);
	}
}
```

^ Mixins can also contain whole nested rules, not just properties.

---

## Arguments

```scss
@mixin headline ($color, $size) {
  color: $color;
  font-size: $size;
}
```

^ Using mixins to apply simple styles is cool, but what makes mixins awesome is that they can take arguments, just like a function in JavaScript or PHP. And you can use them in combination with more advanced features like expressions and functions to go far beyond organization to implement some great, complex styles. [^Dawson, 2015]

---

## Arguments

```scss
@mixin headline ($color, $size) {
  color: $color;
  font-size: $size;
}

h1 {
  @include headline(green, 12px);
}
```

^ A mixin can take Sass data values as arguments. These values are specified when you define the mixin and given when you `@include` the mixin. The arguments are then passed to the mixin as variables. Arguments are included in a comma separated list enclosed in parentheses after the mixin name.

---

## Arguments (compiled CSS)

```css
h1 {
  color: green;
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

^ Here's the compiled CSS.

---

## Arguments Order

```scss
h1 {
  @include headline(12px, green);
}

/* Compiles to... */
h1 {
  color: 12px;
  font-size: green;
}
```

^ As you can see, this doesn’t work. The mixin just delivers the arguments in the order given.

---

## Arguments

```scss
$base-color: pink;

@mixin headline($color, $size) {
  color: $color;
  font-size: $size;
}

h1 { @include headline($base-color, 12px);}
```

^ You can also pass Sass variables as arguments. For example lets say we set a `$base-color` variable in the above example.

---

## Arguments (compiled CSS)

```css
h1 {
  color: pink;
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

^ Here's the compiled CSS.

---

## Default Values

```scss
@mixin headline($size, $color: red) {
  color: $color;
  font-size: $size;
}

h1 {
  @include headline(12px);
}

h1 {
  @include headline(12px, blue);
}
```

^ When creating your mixin you can specify default values for your arguments. When default values are included you can omit passing that value when calling your mixin. The default value will be used. For example if I update the headline mixin from above with a default value.

---

## Default Values (compiled CSS)

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 12px;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

^ In the first `h1` we specified a pixel size, so the default value of red was used. In the second example the default value was replaced by the provided color of blue we used in our `@include`.

---

## Extend

```scss
@extend .myclass;
```

^ Using `@extend` lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. [Demaree, 2011]

---

```scss
.message {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  color: #333;
}

.success {
  @extend .message;
  border-color: green;
}

.error {
  @extend .message;
  border-color: red;
}

.warning {
  @extend .message;
  border-color: yellow;
}
```

---

## Operators

```scss
.container { width: 100%; }

article {
  float: left;
  width: 600px / 960px * 100%; // 62.5%
}

aside {
  float: right;
  width: 300px / 960px * 100%; // 31.25%
}
```

^ Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard math operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and percentages.
